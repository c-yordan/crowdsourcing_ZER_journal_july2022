"David, I don't understand why the people that remained in the island still don't have minimum necessities met... Where did all the millions raised by movie stars, athletes and singers go?? And the millions the government gave??
What about the grids?? I thought the contract was taken away from a shady company and given to a more reputable company and still nothing is brand new!?

"I just got back from Puerto Rico after spending 2 weeks there. One thing I feel it must be covered is how the majority  of the traffic lights are not currently working.  I stayed in Bayamon and drove to San Juan and also Carolina. Every time  you are on a road there you are risking your life because of  this issue. (I lost count of the amounts in which I thought I was going to get into an accident.) The stress level is unreal and driving on those conditions is extremely dangerous. At night it gets worse. There are many roads that do not have any streets lights so one can’t even see where the traffic lanes are, if you are going the right way or the wrong one in a road or any of the numerous potholes. 
Everything seems to be so difficult... this is just an example of one of the issues they are still facing.
If you want to see some of it I can point out specific areas. In the town of Bayamon, near their baseball stadium (the areas behind it... also by the University of Puerto Rico in Bayamon and the streets that crosses it) There are numerous examples but those are the first ones that came to mind. 
I personally didn’t drive to other cities just the ones that I previously mentioned and Toa Baja. But this is the metropolitan area where most  of the traffic cogestión is..it is extremely dangerous. 
Also, you don’t even have to go too far to see it. Right by the San Juan  airport the road that takes you to Piñones is the same and many around it... Another issue is the electricity does that “have it back” are constantly losing it. I lost count of how many times it happened while I was there. The system still very unstable. 
As a matter a fact my mom who lives in the town of Bayamon called me few hours ago to tell me she heard a huge explosion by her house and everything and was told it was one of the electricity generators from the residential area where she lives. It seems to be a common theme as well...

"David, thank you for your planned return visit to Puerto Rico.  Although I do not know the length of your intended stay, I would recommend that if you do have a deadline, you visit the devastated areas first. If you can return on another trip, then go specifically to inquire about this incapable government administration and the whereabouts of the money donated for the victims and the island. It is incongruous that the actual assistance provided has been so limited.  

I have a cousin who went to the island and met with members of Salvation Army, with a truck and they personally delivered water and food to area victims throughout the island.

Although I live on the mainland in New Jersey, I am constantly trying to keep abreast of information and improvements on the island. I have family there and am very concerned for them. 

We lost two elderly family members during this period, my aunt had cancer and without electric it was difficult to keep her comfortable and worry free, since she was very aware of the lack of bare necessities in our town of San Lorenzo. She passed away barely four weeks ago. 
My uncle, a war veteran, was also already ill and bedridden. Without electricity he did not have use of breathing machine or mechanical harness to move him in or out of bed, until until my 94 year old aunt, his wife, who also has cancer, purchased a generator. She and family members tried keeping him stable and air conditioned but, his illness worsened and finally he was transported to Veterans Hospital where he died. Once the electricity came on in sections of the town, the same aunt was still without electric due to a generator that was literally one block away from her home, which controlled a square two block area. She finally got electric about two weeks ago. However, the mountain areas in San Lorenzo are still without electric. 
I am also aware of lack of basics in Cidra, Yauco, Sabana Grande and Yabucoa.

"Wishing you and the team a safe flight to PR, I know you and your team will do a superb job in covering the 6 month anniversary of hurricane Maria with the same commitment, tenacity, and caring that I have come to know of your reports.....in my opinion, I think you should start with municipalities in the central part of the island, since it’s mountainous terrain has made the recovery process, long, slow and difficult for so many of my Puerto Rican’s brothers and sisters, many of whom are still without basics like electricity, clean running water and many of their roads and bridges still impassible.",3/17/2018,en,No,4,0,106
"Hi David and team, a few people have recommended us in Mariana Humacao. We are a hilltop community between Yabucoa and Humacao where we are practicing community self-governance and building long term resilience despite not having electricity and having very inconsistent water service. Ours is the story of people building self-efficacy in how we relate to aid by engaging in reciprocal exchanges among residents to help each other rebuild. @ARECMA is the community non-profit and Proyecto apoyo mutuo Mariana is the initiative. FEMA has been denying a lot of cases in our community and we don’t expect power before the next hurricane season so we are working on a community preparedness plan and not waiting for government to tell us how to survive a massive disaster like Maria.",3/17/2018,en,No,4,0,128
"Yabucoa was the first municipality to get hit by hurricane María and is still to this day in one of the worst conditions. I’m from Ponce, and luckily for us, we are a big municipality in the island and to be one of the first to stand up in its majority even though there are still areas where there is no electricity. Ponce stood up fast, because it’s people stood up fast and helped with the recovery. David, i expect great journalism from you because thanks to you, my family in the states got a real update from what was really happening, and as soon as I got a bit of internet you were the one to bring me up to date on the real situation on the island while most of it was still with no electricity.

There are still some groups who would like and can assist financially and physically, I ask that when you look into these places of need that you create a list of them, and contact info. My non profit CoquiNation.com has some funds and would like to get it to a place that it is needed.

David; I admire what you are doing keeping Puerto Rico out there; it’s a good thing. Much has been done; more needs to be done but PR was a mess before and will continue to be so until the people of Puerto Rico make a change. Towns like ours have dispatched police and utility folk to PR and we have heard plenty and it’s not great.

Please report on the Department of Housing new mission, Tu Hogar Renace, it wasn't evolving like it was meant to when I was there. I saw people in need, specially elders. Saw people not getting the help needed because their house was part of an inheritance and no tittle to their name was available. The middle and rich class is back to normal, but the poor and elders are not. The downtown of each town is back to normal, please try to go deep in each town. About the traffic lights, yes, the majority is not working and poses a safety issue to the citizens. I talked to some home owners that cannot get the materials to rebuild their houses, the Government has 1st priority and not enough construction materials are getting there for people to rebuild.

I tried to enjoy some of the island but as already stated its best to be back home by dark as the roads are ripped up and very dark. You cannot see where you are going and might hit the potholes. Signage is still down so hard to get around as well. I saw crews working all over the island but I could tell it was not enough. Many lost their homes and never been compensated.

People are dying and they are diverting the causes to preconditions which can be understandable in part but in reality the situation in these remote areas are the main cause these least fortunate people are dying.

Vieques, Puerto Rico -- Power Restoration Update – Friday 3/16/18

Power crews left Vieques this week, though their equipment and materials remain. People all over the country have flooded the inboxes of Representatives demanding a resolution to this issue and the return of crews to the island. Progress is being made, but it’s not enough. 

We ask that our followers continue to help Vieques and its people by simply filling out your name and email address into the form provided through this link. The messaging has been done for you. It is so critical that your voice be heard and the pressure be applied to the people who have sworn to work for the interests of their fellow American citizens.

And if you’re on the fence, or unsure if you should take the minute it takes to do this, as some perspective:

People on Vieques have gone six months or longer without access to hot showers, laundry, the ability to cook outside of gas stoves, the ability to store fresh fruits and vegetables. They live in the dark at night, which is exhausting and demoralizing and puts an untold mental strain on people who have already survived one of the worst natural disasters in recent history. Without consistent sources of power, the entire economy is impacted, on an island that was already struggling before the storm.  Businesses are opened and accepting customers and tourists and they need to stay open for the island to thrive. Our medical needs residents have and can face death without a consistent source of power for their equipment (such as nebulizers and CPAP machines), cooling for themselves and medicine (such as insulin) and so much more.

This is not an inconvenience for these people to live through. It can truly be a life or death situation. 

Thank you.",3/17/2018,en,No,2,0,303

Now my other issue is the people in the mountains near San Lorenzo have yet to see or hear from any governmental agencies. FEMA has not been in this area to assess damages or to even distribute any supplies. These families have been relying on the help of family, friends, and neighbors. The water has not been consistent. They still go days without it. They must go to the nearest bigger city, Caguas to get supplies on a daily basis.

Also, wherever you guys go, I think it would be amazing to try getting a count of how many people have died. Cuz officially the number is low and what is officially considered a hurricane-related death is a limited and untrue definition. I'd imagine many more people died than we know. Especially in hospitals, I heard in ICUs they were just filled with dead bodies when the power shut out, but i dunno for sure.

"Hi David, I live in NY, I was in PR in February to visit family in the small town of Maunabo, located south east of the island. It is the next town traveling west after Yabocoa, where Maria made land fall.
Maunabo was badly affected by the hurricane. The people of this pretty and humble town are without electricity since. 
I saw lots of workers everywhere I went on the island and I know task isn’t easy.  I did see many hard working people from Puerto Rico and from many other states and countries. 
I would be great if you went to Maunabo and help to shine a light on  blithe within the beauty of this enchanting countryside. There are stories of death among the sick and elderly. Food isn’t lacking because churches and neighbors help each other. It would be great if they could have help from the government with agricultural growth as most of it was blown away by what my cousins say was like a triple tornado in addition to the hurricane. 
For many years that I travel to Maunabo I knew of all the fresh fruits like from mango trees, plantain trees and many more that are now gone. Wide open space is what you see where trees once stood. 
I tell you this on my own,  the people are hopeful and optimistic, and patient. They go to bed at dusk and rise early. These are the folks from Maunabo, my parents home town .

"Hello Mr. Begnaud

If you really want to see the good, the bad and the ugly, come to Utuado. The good: communities working together to fix what the government is not doing (Caonillas, Tetuán and Mameyes). Fixing intransitable roads and bridges with the scarce money they have. An incredible leader putting together free medical clinic assistance with the help of Antonia Coello and many others, including the donation (Tabuchi system) of a solar system for the clinic. People doing whatever it takes to survive. The bad; the mountains won't have electricity, probably in the next year or ever. We are trying to get financing available for everybody so they can have their own solar system, but it has been very hard. Most of the people have no credit, because they do not have a bank account, plus a lot of them lost their job before or after the hurricane. People trying to install solar systems for their houses to become independent of the fragile system we had and now does not exist. The ugly: people isolated, depress and without hope. This is just a fraction of it. You could see the big things the community is doing and at the same time how fragile it is.",3/17/2018,en,No,2,0,205
"Hi David! You said that you also wanted to share good stuff. By now someone must have told you that Caguas, a major municipality, is still lacking electricity in most of its core. But right at the public square of the town in what use to be three stores you will find Nuestra Escuela, an alternative school for kids who leave public schools. They were located  in a smaller venue three o four streets away from the square. That building had no windows, so without power they could not operate. What did they do, two weeks after María they moved into the vacant building and began giving classes, as well as providing food and water to the people of Caguas. They also began construction of the inside of the school, incorporating trees knocked down by María as part of the process. Students are working on the construction while learning and healing in the process. What they have done is just Amazing!!!!! Ana Yris Guzmán Torres is the school director and she can walk you thru the process.
Also, you must revisit Villa Calma in Toa Baja, self made community leader Milly (remember she saved a lot of people by breaking in to the elementary school an turning it to a shelter) has organized her community in such a way that she is has become a case study for several universities. She is also steps away from incorporating her community in order to build the right case for home owners to get a property tittle. Every community should learn from Villa Calma.

"Hi David! First off thank you so much for everything that you and your team have done and are doing. My family and loved ones are all on the island and there were times you were the only way I knew what was going on. I have a few suggestions:
1) Update on status of electricity for Aguas Buenas. My family is coming up on 6 months with out electricity (they lost it when Irma hit). They keep telling them that next month they will get electricity. Last they heard they were to expect it to happen sometime between August & September.
2) What is really going on with the ""sun tax"" a 30% fee for those that are using or planning on using solar power due to still not having electricity or have unreliable electricity.
3) update on Culebra and Vieques. They tend to be forgotten. 
4) what's the plan for making sure that the power plants and water plants will keep running with out problems.
5) How are they supporting those with Mental Health Issues and those have been traumatized by everything that has happened. I read an article on the increase of suicide after the hurricane
6) What are the plans for those living on the coast? A few weekends ago the coast got hit with 30 foot waves and the videos I saw were very impressive how the waves were coming in to people houses.

They are using the billions of dollars received...money they received to make a profit at the expense of their clients.

"First - thank you for keeping the island in the public eye. You are an angel! I just returned from the island. In my opinion, the most important message to get out to the public is that if you want to support PR - please come and visit. Spend your money here - shop, tip well, go to different resorts and restaurants. I've talked to family members in different areas of the island. Some of the issues they've identified are: 1. Local transportation - They tell me that the ""carro publico"" (these are small vans that provide transportation in the island) are not working normally. They work part of the day. This limits the local shopping, people being able to get to doctor appointments, etc. This isn't in the large metro area - these are towns out in the island 2. Jobs/small business - the lack of electricity has forced many small businesses to open part time as they are using generators. There is an increased cost in doing business (spending money on gasoline/etc for the generators) and less business because they are only operating on a part time basis. I saw many businesses still closed. I've heard insurance companies are taking their time in completing and paying out claims. That needs to be moved along. We are talking about legitimate claims from people that have appropriate coverage and have paid their premiums. I also see a need for small business loans. Many business owners lacked the savings to get them through several months of re-building/lost business. 3. I also saw many larger businesses that have not reopened since the storm. In the San Juan Mall - the two anchor stores (Saks Fifth Ave and Nordstrom) have not returned. These companies have the resources to rebuild. I suspect some may be using the storm as a convenient exit strategy. 4. I remember you had investigated a story a few months ago about bodies exhumed by the storm. I visited a cemetery to check on my grandparents grave. I had a very interesting conversation about that situation while visiting that cemetery.  I thought of you and your efforts. I'd be happy to share my story with your producers if there is any interest. Thank you and my apologies for the long post.",3/17/2018,en,No,1,0,381

"My story started before Maria I went to Puerto Rico for hurricane Irma, then after that Maria came into our lives,  and still remains.

I stayed on the island for Irma, not knowing that Maria was coming, my children and my wife picked up the ball and was able to Bring much-needed supplies to my family and friends on the island including donated over 300 solar light bulbs and other supplies.

When I got to be Island last month five months after the hurricane hit I was moved by how much appreciation friends and family had for our efforts of giving them those solar light bulbs so I came prepared to give out and build personal solar generators. And rebuild my own solar array up on my roof instead of on the ground where they were originally.

Now I'm trying to find funding so that I can build more personal portable solar generators so that people can be more prepared for the next hurricane season. I hope to be back in Puerto Rico within three months. 

I hope that now that power will start to be restored on the island, people don't get A feeling of security, and not prepare for the next hurricane season as most of us usually get. The power grid even though it may be repaired has not been tested and each week there has already been power outages on the areas where they have repaired it. This was a lesson on readiness, for the people that have stayed behind and suffered through all of those have learned a hard lesson I hope they do. Running away from the problem is not the solution it's just temporary comfort so I am proud of those that have stayed behind and made do with what they had, whatever I can do in order to teach and help I will always be here. later I will show you how A simple 500 W solar system that I have on top of my roof is able to keep my house with lights and my refrigerator cold.",3/18/2020,en,No,1,0,343

The East Coast, all the towns in the east coast still have serious problems...The towns in the Mountains, all of them; this is the truths have big problems...
Another matter, money is coming in and help, but the government for them everything is ""half""...let me explain...they don't do a complete job, not with water and worst with the electricity...they started to fix one town, they never finished, then they moved to another town  and they do the same thing all over again with the rest...they never complete the job...that is one reason why this people from these areas or towns doesn't have electricity or in some cases water.
In PR, I believe only one town, have a 100% electricity and water this town name is San Sebastian. ( please check on that, there's maybe more, but not to many). 
Now this is what being going on.
We have others problems with the money that was rise for the people of the hurracain...we don't know where that money went...with the rest of the supply that the people from US, send us.

Meaning,I know many may think that because of the debt there's no money to be made but if that's really the case then how do you explain....

The members of the Fiscal Control board's extravagant salaries are paid by PR,
The secretary of education left her job in the U.S to work in PR for nearly double her old salary. 
Same story keeps repeating  with others leaving their positions of employment in the U.S for PR for more $.
Meanwhile, that's the same reason the middle class leaves the island for the States....

To summarize, Puerto Rico less fortunate makes more $ in the state's and those well fortunate of the state's make more $ in Puerto Rico.....

Thank you David for always keeping people posted on what is actually going on here in Puerto Rico. If it weren't for you everyone would think that the people on this island are completely back on their feet and that everything is normalized when it's not true. The saddest part is that in about 77 days hurricane season begins again and there are still thousands of people without a safe home if another disaster were to occur.

David what a daunting but exciting task you have on your hands! Hit the as much of the different spots you covered( obviously you can't cover everything in such a short time frame) but ideally speak to the people or la gente de los pueblos. let them tell you what they think their needs and concerns are? When you speak to the politicians they tend to be one sided and or are looking for their own best interests which almost all of the times is not necessarily is what their constituents really needed to make lives better. For example did the workforce get paid( police officers or with the plan of privatizing educations means less public schools and teachers loising their jobs) Do they really have a stable electric power infrastructure to ensure people and budinesses can continue to be productive? There are so many needs and questions that need answering? Just my two cents.  Good luck and thank you!,3/17/2018,en,No,0,0,160

"David...you have been amazing and I for one am very fortunate to have seen and continue to see Puerto Rico during, the aftermath and now you are returning for the 6 Month mark.  
I am writing you as I was one of the lucky ones having escaped the storm just 4 days before it hit and flights were grounded.  But I did endure  Irma as it struck Puerto Rico.  I have family in Anasco Puerto Rico my father who is 90 and my mentally retarded sister who now lives with her daddy after my mom passed away 5 years ago. He has a home in Anasco and I visit them often to check on them and provide what I can over the years.  
When I boarded the plane before Maria hit my heart was left behind with them.  I live in Tampa Florida on the water and I have a home that was in the direct path of Maria as well.  And as we know now we were lucky to escape Maria.  
But my father and sister did not.  They lost electricity, water and suffered some damage to the home and property.   My Dads home is on land where as you know other family members live as well it’s the tradition because everyone takes care of each other (not like here).  I was able to get him and my cousin a generator and started a GoFundMe account to help others in the area with supplies and necessities as well as clothing that were donated.  I can’t tell you how often I sent packages thru Fedex.  I couldn’t reach family for weeks and weeks which was so devasting to me and had no way to know how everyone was.  My dad has the best demeanor and believes everything will work out no matter what the challenge is.   I reached them after 4 weeks as my cousin had hit and miss service and called to tell me everyone was ok.  His town and area once they could get out had quite a bit of damage but it didn’t matter to them.  They were going to stay no matter how many times I begged them to come ...they wanted to stay in the land and home.  No one here understands the love the Puerto Rican elederly have for their “Isla de Encanto” but I do.  The area of RR2 in Anasco is where he lives and as he tells me...we have everything we need and things are good.  The area is closing some stores but the residents still remain positive.  He lives on the west side at RR2 box 3077 in Anasco.  Up on the side of a mountain.  This is a good story so I hope you can visit the area and see it’s not all bad.  His name is Severiano Lugo Caban.

"There is a solar field in Isabela, PR. It is supposedly the largest in the Caribbean. Why is it not being used? It's been completed for over a year and just sitting there, especially after a disaster of that magnitude why was it not utilized? We got power in our home 3 weeks ago, could've been home months ago. There is a dichotomy in this recovery, some that are actually thriving- 64 bids last week for a neighbor that had no work prior to Maria, Sky Net and Hughes Net adding new customers left and right while Liberty cable was doing nothing until this last week, Banco Popular doing lots of new mortgage loans for new construction, realtors closing on many homes last week.  Cryptocurrency moving in, and what do we have to look forward to with that? Linemen bringing their families and buying in PR. People reinventing themselves, becoming property managers or taking this opportunity to finally go buy that land and build, adding solar and water for self sufficiency. Ive seen more people look at the land near me in this past month then in the past two years. The airport was bustling with an eclectic mix of people yesterday, many tourists. I had not seen it like that in the past.  I know you will go to the inner parts of the island and show those with no water or electric still, and it's important, very important, because there are still so many suffering, and so much of this seems unfathomable in the way they have been neglected, but the tourism areas are largely back on track, and the island needs that revenue and for people to see how good it actually is.  We went to all of our favorites on the west side over the last month and had excellent food and saw hotels up and running.  You don't have much time to cover all of these bases, but it truly is important to show the world how well many areas have rebounded.  In Jobos, Isabela, PR it was rated one of the top 50 places in the world by the NYT to travel in 2017 and people should still come.  Lastly, I do not know one person that has received money from an insurance company. Stacks and stacks of claims yet to be gone through. The new adjusters just showed up to try to make sense of this and get through the piles. 10,000 small businesses still not open. People like ourselves that had a great deal of damage from water coming in on second floor due to 200 mph wind. We boarded, protected our home, my husband tore his rotator cuff in the process. No windows blew, but a river was created upstairs.  We've paid insurance for years and did everything in our power to protect our home and it fared well in comparison to many, but the run around with insurance and FEMA was ridiculous and all of that time and energy resulted in zero dollars to us and we just went ahead and started replacing things on our own, and it's not easy, but we can. Many small businesses and individuals cannot, and this will result in more great people leaving the island potentially.  You should just come to my house for dinner because I could go on and on. Jaja. Corruption in the government could be a whole page, but I'm sure you've already discovered this. Thank-you, again for all that you have done and now, for not forgetting.

We just returned to Aceitunas, Moca on March 12 to find no water, no electricity, and the garbage hadn't been picked up in 2 months. I learned the water and electricity is taken EVERYDAY! Why? Some residents say they are working on the water pipes from Guajataca and this will continue for 1.5 yr. Really inhumane living conditions.

Even the FEMA emergency director tried to leave them of the disaster map. Please try to get over to the west coast.  Southwestern, as well.  There are still people in towns like Lajas, San German, Cabo Rojo, Mayaguez that have tarps on their homes, storm debris everywhere (no one is picking it up)  The traggic lights do not work, an extremely dangerous situation.  No lights on the roads, and no traffic lights have been repaired.  The roads are damaged with enormous pot holes that are craters.  You have to drive up on peoples properties to go around them.  One very urgent matter that no one is mentioning is that the younger people are leaving, but the old people are still there.  They have no where to go.  They have retired there.  There is also a medical crisis, Doctors are also leaving.  And all the old people that remain will have no health professionals to see them, or prescribe medication.  No one is doing anything to rebuild the infrastructure!!  Where are all the millions that were raised to send help???   What the hell is Trump doing?  He wants to waste our tax dollars on a ridiculous military parade while US citizens in PR need to recover, and rebuild before June - when hurricane season starts again.

1. Why are traffic lights not working.
2. Why haven’t the police been paid over time.
3. Why are the pensions for retirees being lowered, while contracting individuals with over six figure salaries while minimum wage is 7.25.
Contracting to my understanding is approved for exceptions however the governor has made it the norm.

4. Necessities in Viequesekectricity, water, medical needs.
5. UTUADO new bridge. 
6. Hospitals still need medical personnel medicine.

According to the constitution of Puerto Rico , new legislation is suppose to have town meetings in order to have input from the voters prior to changing laws that effect the voters. The current government has by passed this.

The secretary of education has listed jobs for positions out of Puerto Rico. 

Why are the jobs being out sourced not available for professionals on the island who can compete for the positions and help the economy. Especially professions who are Puerto Rican? Who are bilingual understand the culture and are proud of their island.
Why is “ Mandarin language” being forced to be taught in the educational system. Why has a contract for $17,000.000 approved for a course of Values to be taught to Puerto Rican Children in the education system who will only last 5 months.

David we went to PR in January. My husband has a customer there and we try to go once a year. We have always loved it there and consider it our second home. We brought our children and did not hesitate to tour the island and enjoy it as we always do. The island is still beautiful and always will be but We saw power lines in the road and washed out bridges. We drove from San Juan to Humacao where we stay. In Humacao there were no traffic lights. Most gas stations were still closed and communication was limited. Guyama was  hit hard and still struggling as well. In San Juan we met lineman from  Tennessee and were inspired by their work and their decision to come to Puerto Rico for several months to help to restore power.  thank you for your honest reporting and your support of the people of PR.,3/17/2018,en,No,0,1,153

"I still agree that many remote areas are in much more need then the metropolitan area. With that, those of us in the metro area, deal with potholes daily, the infrastructure is very much questionable, very few traffic lights work during our daily commute which means accidents are a norm. Electricity in our home is constantly going off daily and or weekly anywhere from 5min to a few hours. It’s never consistent, and this will eventually fry people’s electronics (inverters, a/c, refrigerators, w/d etc!). The utility posts that provide power have been temporarily fixed, but these bandaids are just that. When will those posts be replaced? They are doomed to fail and at worse fall over sooner or later especially at the next big one!

I am very concern about our next hurricane season, which begins on next first of june. Even a small tropical storm would have the adverse effect of destroying the hard work that has been done so far. We shall not be ready for another hurricane hit. First hurricane warning and many of us will flight outside to the states without hesitation. I am PTSD with the hurricanes.

"The Government can put Sunday in the middle of the week if they wanted to! Every single cent received or allocated in ANY disaster situation should be accounted for. Erase all questions and assumptions simply by being 100% transparent. I have seen this OVER & OVER again in all disaster relief fund situations, be it in the USA or any other country. So many hardworking, kind and compassionate people give their money to assist In these horrific incidents and it always comes down to questions about ‘The Money’. The same occurs when people donate to charities. I have collected A LOT of money for disaster relief throughout the years and I am accountable for every cent. I document everything and I am able to show , to the penny, exactly where their money went. If it is used properly but isn’t enough to accomplish all that needs to be done, then that’s an answer. It’s the mass confusion of having no clue which causes anger and helplessness. Thousands of questions and thousands of different answers does not make one feel secure. It’s 2018 and a damn shame that this is still not organized when it comes to ACCOUNTABILITY.

"I think so many people have reacted and mentioned different places for you to visit. That in itself tells you that the Island is far far behind what the government is reporting in terms of electric power. For example, the power authority mentioned today that about 8% of the population is without electricity. WE ARE ONE OF THAT EIGHT PERCENT. We live on the mountains of Cayey in a beautiful place known as Barrio Cercadillo near Km 5.7. It is very disheartening to see that near our house, the electric poles are still the way María left them six months ago. Water comes and goes. The nights are like in the horror movies, pitch dark with different sounds. FEMA has spent millions but I don’t know where. Besides, if you lost your roof and FEMA wants to visit you after two months to provide you with a tarp; do you think a family can withstand two months without a roof or part of their roof? Construction materials are still scarce. 
I can go on and on for our personal experiences with FEMA, our insurance company and now finally with a SBA loan. If you visit  our town and our Barrio, please ask at Km 5.7 (interior road) and look for yourself what I am trying to explain.

"The United States of America conferred American citizenship to Puerto Rican citizens during WWI so that the US army could draft Puerto Rican males into the army as cannon fodder.  They needed bodies to go to war and die for the US.  Curiously, at about the same time, the American Congress passed the Jones Act.  This Act made importation of goods to Puerto Rico the sole responsibility of American ships.  That meant tha imported goods could only reach Puerto Rico in American ships.  Goods from every other country in the world had to unload in Jacksonville, Florida and reload in American ships.  This caused a huge hike in the price of goods for the Puerto Rican citizens.  And this created jobs for  Americans in Jacksonville.  The Jones Act has been in place for a century now and has cost Puerto Rico billions of dollars.  Billions of dollars.  This money has been stolen from the Puerto Rican people by the government of the United States.

The US has been acting like an abusive southern White master to a subjugated slave country.  And the world--and the United Nations, mind you--have chosen to look the other way and allow this shameful, sadistic, imperial behavior.  And now that Puerto Rico is going through a humanitarian crisis, the United States has chosen not to help.  Hundreds of thousands of Puerto Ricans have left the island.  Thousands of physicians have left the island.  The youth has left the island.  Why should the US care?  Slaves are there to get whupped.

Puerto Rico has been promised much help and has received next to nothing.  Seven hundred thousand Americans living in Puerto Rico have been without power and without water for six months.  And the United States, under the current Republican administration, refuses to help.  

Tell me, if you lived here, if you were a Puerto Rican, an American living in Puerto Rico, what would you do?  I can't answer that question.  Most people here can't.  Most thinking people here have no answer.  They watch impotently as a an entire culture sinks further and further into misery each day, as it begins to disappear.",3/17/2018,en,No,0,0,354

"There was a post around 4 months ago (it wasn't you) informing people that houses or properties that was left by the people that left the island , or houses that are simply not ocupied are been marked by the municipalities with a yellow mark on front of them indicating they are abandon so the mayors would sell them to outsiders. The families that moved to the main land don't know and they loose their properties.  Some of those properties have been paid off for years by their original owners,  have been pass on from generations.  I just want to know how true is that. And if is not true, what cause this rummor. With corruption in the educational budget and the amount of help that it was laid forgotten to rott, it would not surprise me. Also, this pass March 14th there was a meeting, it continues for the rest of this weekend; it has been announced a conference through YOUTUBE at the Sheratton in San Juan where the are inviting people from all over the world to buy all these cheap properties abandone by the Puertorricans. They are intructing people in how to stablish their satillite business and take advantage of all the incentives (tax exempts) for business people from the main land or other countries. The problem is that a Puertorrican Business person cannot take advantage of this tax exempt incentives as is only made for outsiters and the money produced by these prospevtive companies doesn't stay in the Island. It goes to their main quaters. ¿How puertorricans could compete with them, without inventives? The Puertorrican Business is the only source of tax generated from that stays in the island to build the economy. The rest, goes back either to the main land or other countries business owner headquaters. I'm very worry about that.",3/17/2018,en,No,0,0,307

"I would check with PREPA and the Army Corps of Engineers what exactly are they doing to the electrical system in Puerto Rico?

Puerto Rico wants reassurances that when another storm hits, and see that I say when, not if, what has happened since Hurricane Maria won’t happen again.  Puerto Rico also needs reassurance that the areas that have gotten electricity back aren’t having power outages every other day.  This damages refrigerators, stoves, air conditioners, food and medicine with this constant disruption.

"I am unfortunately on the island right now for my Grandmother’s funeral.  I was last here in February 2017, way before Maria hit.  Driving from San Juan to the west, I couldn’t help but notice many roofs with the blue tarps.  Obviously, many homes are still in need of repairs.  For the most part, the roads are decent, with the exception of the smaller towns.... I drove through an intersection today that had only a portion of a non working traffic signal dangling from it.  No need to explain how scary it is crossing a non- signaled 4 lane road in the dark of night! 
The bureaucracy in PR was terrible to deal with BEFORE the storm.  Let’s multiply it!  For example,  my grandmother passed away this past Thursday in a hospital.  I managed to get my home in order and travel from Philadelphia to PR in less than 24 hours, but it took more than 10 phone calls from a funeral director and a call from an angry grand daughter to find a doctor to sign a death certificate?  The process to get ANYTHING done here is outrageous!  It certainly explains a lot about the island’s potential for any type of recovery.
Please have a safe trip, and as always, keep up the good work!❤️❤️❤️",3/17/2018,en,No,0,0,215

"David, Rincon PR is an iconic surf town now experiencing record setting waves. They hold a national surf competition there every year. There is a film festival coming up in town shortly. 
The story is, without the town’s people turning a beer company into a soup kitchen to feed all of the town’s people and a group currently forming to raise funding in order to build a well in one of it’s barrios so they’ll have dependable water for once, there would be much more suffering (keeping in mind on the mainland we wouldn’t tolerate these conditions). As it is, in that barrio in Rincón, known as Puntas, many tourist spots depend on regular water to keep their businesses open and employees working. It’s a good story about a beautiful part of the island’s west coast and it’s people finding ways to move forward despite unreasonable odds. This would be a more positive story...still dealing with power and water struggles. Survival on “The Road to Happiness” as Route 413 is known  in Rincón, would be uplifting yet wrought with decades long issues that residents choose to tolerate over leaving the island. The mountainous areas where Maria first hit are devastating and need to be heard. As well, the story of the trade winds side of the island’s west coast struggles renewal and plodding to form answers to decades long issues, is one to be heard. Rincon is ready for business and would benefit greatly by your visit! Please do us the honor of allowing us to serve you at the best sunset restaurant, talk with those working about a well project for regular water service and help to promote a side of the island that is ready to serve tourists, has a lot to offer and depends on their business.

"Thank you David for going back to Puerto Rico. 
I am so glad that you and your team are returning to the island.  I just returned to NJ after four months helping family and friends in PR. I visited many towns, bringing battery switch lights and solar lights to the elderly and poor families in many remote areas of the island. I was so impressed and humbled by the resilience , the fighting spirit and the faith demonstrated by my people. 
There is so much going on there. If you want to know about successful stories where the mayor and the community worked together to clean up and provide electricity to the town by creating its own electric company made up by retired electricians and AEE employees go to San Sebastián. By December the town looked beautiful. It is a town on the west side of the island, near Aguadilla.  His name is Javier Jimenez. 

If you want to see how forgotten some communities have been, go to the towns in the center of the island like Morovis, Orocovis, Maunabo, Aibonito y Corozal.
Go to Yabucoa where the storm hit first. All those towns still have no electricity, no blue tarps to cover their broken roofs, and no roads or bridges.
Ask the mayors about the gift that the governor send them for Christmas.  He send them a candle. They have no electricity and he send them a candle.
Most of the money given to Unidos for Puerto Rico have gone to non profit organizations and individuals who many of them created their businesses or organizations after Hurricane Maria.
Many communities have been able to survive thanks to the donations of food , water, and money send by generous fellow Americans and Puertorricans living on the states. We will forever be grateful to them and to people like you that provided us with information and support during our darkest times. Good luck to you and your team.

It took months to make this happen. Now there is finally a huge crowd docked at the port with 500 workers from different states helping to bring up the grids, which we are really great full or as well as the people of the town. But... why did it take so long? My mom was one of the lucky ones to get power this week. But others in her neighborhood, even in the same street didn't. There are still many areas without power and it's breaking the bank of many people in such a broken economy. Check out how much these small business have to invest in keeping their generators so they can be back on business. Thank you very much for keeping PR on the news.

"David Begnaud, Thank You for taking on the challenge of showing the world the truth about life in Puerto Rico 6 months after Maria. I ask that you pay a visit to the island of Vieques. Residents of VQS were virtually cut off from the rest of the world for weeks after the hurricane hit. No electricity, no potable water. no phone service of any kind. Mayor and other municipal leaders were virtually invisible, offering little to no public info to survivors. Being an island off another island presents challenges in the best of times. I think it would be valuable to hear and see how the island's people worked together to help one another through this tragic event, where government aid was a case of too little, too late. In Vieques today, you will find examples of both triumph and hardship. Hundreds remain without power. Medical care is a challenge because hospital was badly damaged and ferry service to and from mainland PR for medical care is unreliable. Landlines are not operational, and cell service is spotty at best. Municipal government is of little to no use or help, with Mayor currently suspended from office and acting Mayor under investigation. With all these hardships, the good people of the island have worked together to rebuild the island they love. From establishment of charity organizations to raise emergency funds immediately after the. Hurricane hit, to organized beach clean-up efforts, to grass root efforts to rebuild a neighbors roof or bring a hot meal to the elderly or sick. I could go on and on detailing the countless acts of selfless kindness that have occurred and continue on the island, but better that you pay a visit to Vieques and see for yourself.

Here is what I saw and I didn’t travel a lot because the time and situation didn’t allow me. Some a lot of the areas still WITHOUT POWER. From his house up the Mountain where my grandma and aunts, uncles and cousins live still didn’t have any power. Everything had to be done in a rush during the day before night fell, I DID SEE some electrical trucks and guys working to get new light posts up, and that was good to see! I didn’t want to venture out, THE TRAFFIC LIGHTS ARE NOT WORKING! I feared for my life every time I left the house! It is my understanding from the people were telling me, these men and their trucks are being pulled out of there by the end of the month. Thank you so much for the ones there and the ones who have helped! There is still a lot of work to be done. Our PR people are amazing, I did Not hear or see people complaining about it just moving on with life and the “New Normal”, they help each other out and are doing what they can to survive. Although my grandpa was 95. He was the healthiest and strongest old man I have known, he had the sharpest mind, got around, without hardly any help. I believe 3 to 4’months into the last storm, we were informed he was uneasy, little anxious and stressed about not getting back to his regular day to Day simple things in life. Thank God that my parents and family there can take him to see his doctors without any issues, some people there cant do that still. He suffered a massive stroke, so if you ask me the hurricanes and the condition of  the island not being able to recover, not being able to get back to the normal things in life was his deterioration of his quality of life. We are blessed to have him with us that long, most don’t get to that age and sharp as he was. There is STILL ALOT OF WORK TO BE DONE.

"Vieques: 6 months on we have power for probably 85%. That’s the good, but the bad is that PREPA somehow has forced the big line crews off the island with the job un finished. They claim to have many of their own folks working here, but people have only seen a few. Big diesel generators are making power but who knows for how long as there’s no money to continue to buy fuel, and many people here beleive that they don’t have to pay an electric bill because the power is not being generated on the big island - magical thinking!     Tourists are returning but many restaurants and businesses have remained closed or given up the ghost.

Civic pride is strong, yet the Mayer has been removed from office for malfeasance and apparently his replacement is no better. Like the Trumpian model they emulate, they tried to fire the one guy who was really helping and have threatened several folks who are speaking up.  Tesla bestowed a migrogrid unto the Emergency room here, but the building is so infested with mold that it has been abandoned, and the solar panels produce electricity for no one.

"Hello David !
First of all i want to thank you for your continiuos support in the name of all the people that have bee affected by Maria. My name is Erika Velez and i am president of Puerto Rico Lit.

"Go to Robinson School in San Juan. Talk to the students. They are wonderfully articulate and they speak English. They have been involved in Maria rescue and help efforts in many ways. Robinson was (I think) the first school in the island) to open its doors after the storm. They provided facilities for teachers to shower and get ready to teach in the morning when these folks had no facilities at home. The alums got together and collected money to give all the teachers and staff a bonus so they could have a bit extra for Hurricane expenses. Because the kids like staying at school ( it’s air conditioned, there’s power, friends, computers) they keep the doors open... later even took the extra step and hosted ‘movie nights’ and sleep overs for some classes. This is a good news story on every sense of the word. They took care of their own and the kids, faculty and parents went out in the community and extended themselves incredibly.

Please report on the problem of animal abandonment on the island. This has been a major problem for many years before the hurricane struck. The Humane Society of the US and other organizations are performing sterilization clinics throughout the island this year. The college of  veterinarians of Puerto Rico should have been doing more to address the overpopulation of cats and dogs. They should be going to the hard to reach towns to spay and neuter. They should also have worked with other national animal organizations many years ago. If they had Puerto Rico would look like a third world country with regards to it's inhumane treatment of animals. The dept. of tourism should also be working on this issue as many animal loving tourists are scarred after seeing the starving cats and dogs.,3/17/2018,en,No,0,0,134

My major concern rests in the cause of this tragic situation... and that is in the ongoing corruption that has permeated the government for some time. The corruption within the political arena and governmental system is the root cause to why Puerto Rico is even in the current state of affairs that it is in. How will Puerto Rico rebuild and then even more importantly, maintain what it has rebuilt when corruption eats at the heart of those in power. How will PR be prepared to weather any natural disaster without the proper infrastructure it deserves and should have already had. The political lying ,
cheating and stealing is horrific and hurts the beautiful island and its wonderful people and leaves nothing to what can be a glorious extension of the US, well it’s shameful .",3/17/2018,en,No,0,0,175

He told me he worked with Fluor but after 60 days in PR only got to put up 2 poles, amazing! He was not allowed to speak to the press and express himself about how ashamed he was to look at people he encountered at the towns he worked at and know that he was doing nothing to help restore the power. He went there to work not just sit around at a location taken and do nothing. He worked with LU 222. This is where the money is going, to these companies that are stealing from PR. This man was so tired of doing nothing to help and was told he would get fired if he spoke to the press or put something on social media, that he decided to quit and leave. He was told that he was getting paid and thats what mattered nothing else. So he paid his airplane ticket and left on February 28, 2018 after 60 day of accomplishing 2 standing poles.

David let me start by saying thank you for all you did when these hurricanes hit. We live in Elkhart In and knew nothing about our love ones in the Island. Then we started following you and found out more from your team than anyone else.  May God bless you always and protect you and your team. With all that said My mom lives in Yabucoa PR in the Mendez Urb. They still to this day have no power. Some places in Yabucoa where the hurricane Maria came through have electricity but a lot of them are still with no power. Depression has kicked in along with hunger and desperation. Seeing light around them but them not having any is hard to swallow. They feel forgotten and alone.,3/17/2018,en,No,0,0,128
"David Begnaud, in the hopes of still being on time for you to possibly consider visiting our community of Pellejas 2 sector Novillo in Orocovis. We have been told by the Corps of Engineers that it will take 3 years or more for the electricity to be restored to this community. More than 30 families live here and their water service depends on the electrical grid! So far they have  some water pumping into their homes on ocasions when the generator is fired up to turn on the pump. When you speak to these people they are resigned to not having electricity ever. They know because they can see the poles and cables tangled up in the bushes. So my husband and I have started a small project of lighting up these homes with led lights connected to their car battery, if they have one. We have been financing this with our own modest means but eventually we want to set them up with a functional and economic solar system that can supply them with juice for a refrigerator, lights and devices with donations from those that want to help out the people directly and not through organizations that do not trickle down the donations to those truly in need. Thank you for the work you have been doing to keep our island’s tribulations in the public eye",3/17/2018,en,No,0,0,228

"my input is that it is truly unbelievable that there are still PR citizens without power or water. It is hard to wake up every morning and go to bed every night knowing that some of my students  are still without basic utilities and still they need to be in school and be responsible of assignments and are bombarded on how to be responsible with their school stuff and their parents have to go to work to spend their little salaries on gas for their house generators or to fix the generators that have been damaged due to the overuse. My input is that is unbearable that elderly people are dying due to the lack of power. That hospices and many places that take care of our elderly people are still working on generators. It’s frustrating driving around and for every two traffic lights there’s one major intersection still without power. It’s overwhelming that we have to pay the ridiculous amount of taxes that we have to pay and the outrageous power bills that most of the people in the island pay every month and there is still thousands of people in the island without power. It is frustrating that those of us who had the chance to leave, but decided to stay because there is no better place like Home and to do something to help our beloved island to get back on track get the miserable salaries that we get paid every month, and know how much foreign people are getting paid for things people in the island not linked to politics can do but prefer to leave and go somewhere else. Sir with all your respect, you could do a lot more than what you are doing. Coming on a planned visit, where the government is going to guarantee you to only see what has been done and still forgetting those in the rural areas doesn’t count, doesn’t make a difference. Like when president Trump was here and was taken to one of the cities with least damage where also lots of rich people live. No sir. That is not what this island need.  You need to set a foot and be here and live among us, live the unexpected power outages, etc. Please, don’t talk to the governmental figures, talk to us, the people, fold-up your shirt leaves and go to places like Comerio, Yabucoa, Jayuya, to name a few.",3/18/2020,en,No,0,0,404

I would advise your team to research how this administration is handling money. how is it that a in a broke and devastated country there is no money for our recovery but there are a lot of suspicious contracts surfacing with outrageous salaries. how is it that the Junta de Control Fiscal are still cashing in such enormous amounts while eliminating our basic needs such as education and health. how can we recover if the government keeps eliminating schools or privatizing essential services? a lot of teachers being fired, schools are at risk because the governor is implementing a charter program that has failed in the US and later admitted he didn’t even bother looking for other options. why are they so willing to take money away from public schools and universities instead of cutting expenses elsewhere? why are municipalities wasting so much money on advisory contracts and not investing in reconstruction efforts? why is there no help for local businesses that are still struggling to reopen but foreigners are flooding in to buy properties and establishing businesses that benefit from our dire situation. who is this administration really serving?  it is certainly not us.

All the money spent on contracts to reestablish the Power on the Island, is going to hold the work done? is Safe? or will be Worst if something happen again this year or next year? We want to know if the work they did is Safe! if they have a Plan for Next time!! With my Experience here on the Island in hurricane Maria is that I don’t think a that many people will stay on the Island if another hurricane hits. The government is Not looking ahead of time, We need to Improve The Power System to a “New Era"" something like Tesla , Why the Government don’t want Good Improvements? Change the Old System!! Once again, What are We going to do if another Hurricane Hits The Island??!! Please check into this!! Thank You!! God Bless You!!",3/18/2020,en,No,0,0,192

The East most definitely.  My family from Yabucoa doesn't have water or electricity services. They barely benefit from aid because by the time they arrive to these locations the items have already been given out. I'm also concerned about their emotional health.  Living under these conditions is very challenging and too easy for anyone to feel anxiety and depression.,3/18/2020,en,No,0,0,59

"David, while you visit these still devastated areas on the island please notice; parts of the electrical grid that have been repaired are in better shape then in the last 30 years. Then ask yourself why sell the electrical company, hundreds of millions to restore the grid then the government wants to sell? Who is making money on the side? I still feel ashamed to say I have power in my home well knowing most people don't. The numbers the government are giving don't match with reality. Good luck on you venture.
